Lemonbar wrapper written in rust. It has two commands: daemon and remote.

Daemon launches lemonbar and detaches itself from terminal. Remote sends commands to daemon instance.

It is configured through Xresources. Also it can be extended with various modes. See 'remote' help section for details.

Log files are in user's cache directory. Socket and pid files are in the user's runtime directory or in /tmp. Mode directory is in user's config directory.

Note: currently it works only with bspwm, maybe I'll add more wm support in the future.
